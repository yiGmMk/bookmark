Note

This repo is for the ACI.dev platform. If you're looking for the **Unified MCP** server built with ACI.dev, see [aci-mcp](https://github.com/aipotheosis-labs/aci-mcp).

ACI.dev is the open-source infrastructure layer for AI-agent tool-use. It gives your agents intent-aware access to 600+ tools with multi-tenant auth, granular permissions, and dynamic tool discovery‚Äîexposed as either direct function calls or through a **Unified Model-Context-Protocol (MCP) server**.

**Example:** Instead of writing separate OAuth flows and API clients for Google Calendar, Slack, and more, use ACI.dev to manage authentication and provide your AI agents with unified, secure function calls. Access these capabilities through our **Unified**[MCP server](https://github.com/aipotheosis-labs/aci-mcp) or via our lightweight [Python SDK](https://github.com/aipotheosis-labs/aci-python-sdk), compatible with any LLM framework.

Build production-ready AI agents without the infrastructure headaches.
