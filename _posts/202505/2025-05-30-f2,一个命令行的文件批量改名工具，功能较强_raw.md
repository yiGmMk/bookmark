Title: f2

**[f2](https://github.com/ayoisaiah/f2)** ([via](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44081850 "Hacker News")) Really neat CLI tool for bulk renaming of files and directories by Ayooluwa Isaiah, written in Go and designed to work cross-platform.

There's a _lot_ of great design in this. [Basic usage](https://f2.freshman.tech/guide/tutorial) is intuitive - here's how to rename all `.svg` files to `.tmp.svg` in the current directory:

```
f2 -f '.svg' -r '.tmp.svg' path/to/dir
```

f2 defaults to a dry run which looks like this:

```
*————————————————————*————————————————————————*————————*
|      ORIGINAL      |        RENAMED         | STATUS |
*————————————————————*————————————————————————*————————*
| claude-pelican.svg | claude-pelican.tmp.svg | ok     |
| gemini-pelican.svg | gemini-pelican.tmp.svg | ok     |
*————————————————————*————————————————————————*————————*
dry run: commit the above changes with the -x/--exec flag
```

Running `-x` executes the rename.

The really cool stuff is the advanced features - Ayooluwa has thought of _everything_. The EXIF integration is particularly clevel - here's an example [from the advanced tutorial](https://f2.freshman.tech/guide/organizing-image-library) which renames a library of photos to use their EXIF creation date as part of the file path:

```
f2 -r '{x.cdt.YYYY}/{x.cdt.MM}-{x.cdt.MMM}/{x.cdt.YYYY}-{x.cdt.MM}-{x.cdt.DD}/{f}{ext}' -R
```

The `-R` flag means "recursive". The small `-r` uses variable syntax [for EXIF data](https://f2.freshman.tech/guide/exif-variables). There are plenty of others too, including [hash variables](https://f2.freshman.tech/guide/file-hash-variables) that use the hash of the file contents.

#### Installation notes

I had Go 1.23.2 installed on my Mac via Homebrew. I ran this:

```
go install github.com/ayoisaiah/f2/v2/cmd/f2@latest
```

And got an error:

```
requires go >= 1.24.2 (running go 1.23.2; GOTOOLCHAIN=local)
```

So I upgraded Go using Homebrew:

```
brew upgrade go
```

Which took me to 1.24.3 - then the `go install` command worked. It put the binary in `~/go/bin/f2`.

There's also [an npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ayoisaiah/f2), similar to the pattern I wrote about a while ago of people [Bundling binary tools in Python wheels](https://simonwillison.net/2022/May/23/bundling-binary-tools-in-python-wheels/).
